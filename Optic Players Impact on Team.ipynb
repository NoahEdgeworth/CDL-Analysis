In addition, Optic is 4-1 and when he has at least a 1 KD. And only 2-4 when he goes below a 1 KD. It is safe to say when Shotzzy is playing well the team is winning.\n",
    "2) His kryptonite, as of Major 1, is Faze. Three of his 4 worst series come against Faze. All of which include losses.\n",
    "3)  Final point is just the difference on LAN an Online. Jan 25-28th was on LAN. Dec 8-Jan 21st was Online. There is not any real noticeable difference in his play from online to LAN."

    "My takeaways for Dashy from the data after analyzing is as follows:\n",
    "1) Dashy is a MAJOR factor on if Optic wins matches or not. Optic is 6-0 when Dashy has an above average KD. With their closest series being a 3-1. When Dashy is performing below league average they are 1-5, with their only win in a game 5 victory against Vegas Legion.\n",
    "2) Something we will more than likely see for all Optic players is their poor performance vs Faze in all three matchups so far this year. Like Shotzzy, Dashy's worst two series this year are vs Faze\n",
    "3) With 3 out of his top 6 performances being on LAN and the other 3 online, I would conclude that he is pretty consistent across both. Do note that 3 of his 4 worst performances did come online, so when he is playing at his worst it is usually online."

    "These are my biggest takeaways from Pred's Major 1:\n",
    "1) Pred is only 1 of 2 plays the whole Major to drop over 90 kills on Faze; Scrap being the other one. This along with his high KD in all three matches against Faze show that, unlike Shotzzy and Dashy, he actually plays pretty well vs them\n",
    "2) Pred having over 25% of his teams kills in 9/12 series in Major 1 shows just how big of an impact he is on the map. His stats and play throughout this Major is reminiscent of the retired Optic legend Scumpii. \n",
    "3) Another impressive stat I noticed was that Pred's lowest KD on LAN was 1.16. While he is still good online, his best performances come on LAN.\n",
    "4) To close it out, Pred clearly plays a big role on this team, as long as he continues to play well and lead this team they should all follow suit behind him."

    "Recap of Kenny's Major 1:\n",
    "1) Overall Kenny had a very average Major. Going above the average KD 6 times, the team won 5/6 of those times. This is pretty standard across the team, as in when a player does well they usually tend to win.\n",
    "2) Following that up, one noticeable stat from Kenny was that he had over 25% of the teams deaths in 10 out of 12 matches in major 1. This could turn into a problem for Optic if he doesnt get this under control quickly. With the role he plays on the team, he should not be over a quarter of the teams deaths. This just goes back to winning those 1 on 1 gun fights a lot of the time.\n",
    "3) Overall, not a terrible Major from Kenny, but he certainly needs to clean up his deaths going into the next Major. Every loss but one, he accounted for over 25% of the deaths for his team. This could turn out to be a pivotal reason on if Optic wins or loses going forward."

    "WHOLE TEAM RECAP FOR MAJOR 1:\n",
    "1) Without a doubt the two best players for Optic in Major 1 was Pred and Dashy. Kenny and Shotzzy had unusually poor performances in comparison to their two counterparts.\n",
    "2) As you can see above, I went ahead and checked every players count of how many times they went over 25% of the teams deaths. Shottzy and Kenny both with 10, while Dashy and Pred have 1 and 5. This undoubtedly contributes to the individual players success, which in turn plays into how the team performs.\n",
    "3) To wrap up, Optic had a good Major finishing 3rd overall. I think with a little better play from Kenny and Shotzzy this team could become a force to be reckoned with. I am looking forward to the adjustments they make going into Major 2"
